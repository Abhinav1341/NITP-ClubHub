# NITP ClubHub

Welcome to the NITP ClubHub project â€“ your official platform for staying informed about the exciting events organized by various clubs within our institution!

## Introduction

The Institute's Club Events Website is a dedicated platform designed to provide you with up-to-date information about upcoming, ongoing, and past events hosted by our dynamic campus clubs. Our project is divided into two distinct versions, each tailored to enhance your experience and streamline event participation:

### Version 1

Version 1 of our website is all about accessibility and information. Here, you'll find:

- Event details at your fingertips.
- Registration information to help you secure your spot.
- Club descriptions and contact details.
- A user-friendly interface designed to promote club events and encourage participation.

### Version 2

Get ready to take your event experience to the next level with Version 2! In this phase, we're introducing:

- Dynamic features that keep you engaged.
- User authentication for personalized interactions.
- Seamless event registration to simplify your journey.
- A platform that bridges the gap between traditional library services and cutting-edge technology.
